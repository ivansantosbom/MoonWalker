# MoonWalker

Another Brute Forcer for Puzzle #66 based on CUDA

#What is this tool ?

MoonWalker is a software based on Bitcrack and VanitySearch, this tool is made to search by brute force bitcoin private keys using full CUDA calculation and search for hash160 sufix to speed up calculations.

I made it specifically to search bitcoin puzzle addresses.

#BETA !
actually this is a beta version that works only from 1 - 63 bits range.


to build a software like this I spent many months of research and development, actually I just want to join forces with someone with enought computer power to split the prize. are you this one ?

#How to Use it ?

Moonwalker.exe 80000:FFFFF 18ZMbwUFLMHoZBbfpCjUJQTCMCbktshgpe
